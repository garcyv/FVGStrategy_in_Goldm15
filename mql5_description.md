# FvgGold — Fair Value Gap EA for XAUUSD

## Overview

FvgGold is an Expert Advisor for trading Gold (XAUUSD) on MetaTrader 5. It uses institutional trading concepts — Fair Value Gaps (FVG), Order Blocks, and killzone sessions — to enter high-probability trades with a fixed risk-to-reward ratio.

Unlike most free EAs that use dangerous grid or martingale systems, FvgGold takes one quality trade at time, scored and filtered by multiple confluence factors.

## Key Features

### Quality Scoring System (0–100)
Every Fair Value Gap is scored across five weighted components. Only setups meeting the minimum score threshold are traded. This filters out weak patterns and keeps only the best opportunities.

### Order Block Confluence
When an FVG overlaps with an institutional Order Block, the setup receives a +20 score bonus. This ensures entries are backed by institutional supply/demand zones.

### H1 EMA Trend Filter
The EA uses the H1 50/200 EMA crossover to determine the higher timeframe bias. Trades are only taken in the direction of the trend — buys when fast EMA is above slow EMA, sells when below.

### London/NY Killzone Timing
The EA only activates during peak liquidity windows:
- London Open: 07:00–10:00 GMT
- London/NY Overlap: 12:00–16:00 GMT
- NY Session: up to 21:00 GMT

### Fixed Risk-to-Reward
Each trade uses a fixed 1.5 R:R ratio. Entry is placed near the FVG edge (not midpoint) with stop-loss beyond the zone and take-profit at 1.5× the risk distance.

### Risk Management
- Fixed lot sizing (default 0.01)
- Maximum 1 concurrent trade
- Daily loss limit ($5 default)
- Break-even at 0.5× ATR profit
- On-chart dashboard with real-time session info

## Strategy Explained

FvgGold uses a five-step process for each trade:

1. Detect — Scans M15 for three-candle Fair Value Gap patterns (institutional imbalance zones)
2. Score — Rates each FVG 0–100 based on gap size, candle displacement, H1 trend alignment, freshness, and premium/discount positioning
3. Confirm — Checks for Order Block confluence (+20 bonus) and H1 EMA 50/200 trend direction
4. Filter — Only activates during London/NY killzone sessions for peak liquidity
5. Execute — Places a limit order near the FVG edge with fixed 1.5 R:R and manages via break-even
